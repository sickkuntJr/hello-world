# hello-world
This repo is for testing github features.

I'd like to mainly explore features about web scraping, databases, machine learning and generative models.
I also want to complete my skillset with some full-stack knowledge to be able to bundle my projects into neat little applications.

My main discipline is organic synthesis (chemistry). Although it seems way different, synthesis and coding is quite simmilar. You throw in stuff built by others together to produce a desired end-result and if you add them in the right order and in the right conditions - it works. The only difference is that chemistry is expensive and can be lethal if you're not careful.
